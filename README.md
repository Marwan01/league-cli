# league-cli

Command line interface for League of Legends Players. Can be used to look up champions and their counters.

## Usage

This is an interactive node app that runs in your terminal. Use numeric commands and then the enter key to interact with the CLI. If pick option 1 you can get the most updated list of all the champions with their numeric ids. If you use option 2 you can enter either the champion's name (no spaces, no special chars) or the champion's numeric equivalent from the list in option 1. Any other keys followed by enter will terminate the program.
